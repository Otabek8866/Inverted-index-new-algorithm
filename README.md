# Inverted-index-new-algorithm
This new inverted index algorithm calculates which files contain the desired text and the lines that contain most of the text and prints all the possible cases in the best match order. This new algorithm has been implemented in python. Currently, this source code supports only text format files and any other security or error cases have not been considered. Just use this algorithm for gettig a new way of text searching.
